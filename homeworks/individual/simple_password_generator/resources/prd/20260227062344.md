## Original Requirements

Create a simple Python command-line password generator.

## Project Name

simple_password_generator

## Product Goals

- Generate secure passwords easily via command-line
- Allow users to customize password length and complexity
- Ensure user-friendly and clear command-line interface

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to generate a random password with a specified length
- As a user, I want to include or exclude special characters, numbers, and uppercase letters in my password
- As a user, I want to copy the generated password easily
- As a user, I want clear instructions and error messages if I enter invalid input

## Competitive Analysis

- pwgen (Linux): Simple CLI, limited customization
- LastPass CLI: Advanced features, requires account
- KeePassXC CLI: Secure, but complex for beginners
- Python's secrets module example scripts: Basic, not user-friendly
- Dashlane CLI: Requires subscription, advanced features
- Bitwarden CLI: Secure, but requires setup
- Random.org password generator: Web-based, not CLI

## Requirement Analysis

The main requirement is to create a simple, user-friendly Python command-line tool for generating secure passwords. The tool should allow users to specify password length and optionally include/exclude character types (uppercase, numbers, special characters). It should provide clear instructions, handle invalid input gracefully, and output the generated password in a way that's easy to copy. Advanced features like saving passwords or integration with password managers are out of scope for this version.

## Requirement Pool

- ['P0', 'Generate a random password with user-specified length']
- ['P0', 'Allow users to include/exclude uppercase, numbers, and special characters']
- ['P1', 'Provide clear command-line instructions and error messages']
- ['P1', 'Allow easy copying of the generated password']
- ['P2', 'Support for saving generated passwords to a file']

## UI Design draft

A simple command-line interface that prompts the user for password length and character set options (uppercase, numbers, special characters). After input, the generated password is displayed clearly. Error messages are shown for invalid input. Minimalistic and clear text-based layout.

## Anything UNCLEAR

No major unclear aspects. Clarification needed on whether password saving or clipboard copy should be included in the first version.
