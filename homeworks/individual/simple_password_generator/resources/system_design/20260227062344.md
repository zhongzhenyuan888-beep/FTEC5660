## Implementation approach

We will implement a simple, user-friendly command-line password generator in Python. The standard library's 'secrets' module will be used for secure random password generation, and 'string' for character sets. For clipboard copy functionality, we will use the open-source 'pyperclip' library, which is cross-platform and lightweight. The CLI will be built using argparse for clear argument parsing and help messages. The program will validate user input (length, character set options), provide clear error messages, and display the generated password in a way that's easy to copy. Advanced features like password saving are out of scope for the initial version, but the design will allow for future extension.

    class PasswordGenerator {
        +__init__(use_uppercase: bool, use_numbers: bool, use_special: bool)
        +generate(length: int) str
    }
    class CLI {
        +parse_args() dict
        +display_password(password: str)
        +display_error(message: str)
        +copy_to_clipboard(password: str)
        +run()
    }

## Program call flow


sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant CLI as CLI
    participant PG as PasswordGenerator
    U->>CLI: run()
    CLI->>CLI: parse_args()
    CLI->>PG: __init__(use_uppercase, use_numbers, use_special)
    CLI->>PG: generate(length)
    PG-->>CLI: password
    CLI->>CLI: display_password(password)
    alt If --copy flag is set
        CLI->>CLI: copy_to_clipboard(password)
    end
    alt If invalid input
        CLI->>CLI: display_error(message)
    end


## Anything UNCLEAR

No major unclear aspects. Clipboard copy will be included using pyperclip. Password saving to file is out of scope for this version, but can be added later if needed.
