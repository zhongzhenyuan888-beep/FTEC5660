{"Implementation approach":"We will implement a simple, user-friendly command-line password generator in Python. The standard library's 'secrets' module will be used for secure random password generation, and 'string' for character sets. For clipboard copy functionality, we will use the open-source 'pyperclip' library, which is cross-platform and lightweight. The CLI will be built using argparse for clear argument parsing and help messages. The program will validate user input (length, character set options), provide clear error messages, and display the generated password in a way that's easy to copy. Advanced features like password saving are out of scope for the initial version, but the design will allow for future extension.","File list":["main.py"],"Data structures and interfaces":"\nclassDiagram\n    class PasswordGenerator {\n        +__init__(use_uppercase: bool, use_numbers: bool, use_special: bool)\n        +generate(length: int) str\n    }\n    class CLI {\n        +parse_args() dict\n        +display_password(password: str)\n        +display_error(message: str)\n        +copy_to_clipboard(password: str)\n        +run()\n    }\n    PasswordGenerator <..
